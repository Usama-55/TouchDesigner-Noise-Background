🎛 Procedural Noise System – TouchDesigner (CHOP-Based)

A real-time procedural noise generator built in TouchDesigner using CHOPs (Channel Operators).
This project focuses on channel-based signal generation and manipulation to create dynamic animated outputs.

Unlike typical TOP-based visual noise systems, this project uses CHOP noise signals to drive motion, animation, and parameter modulation.

Channel-driven animation workflow


⚙️ How It Works

This project generates procedural noise signals using Noise CHOP, which produce time-based channel data.

Core Workflow:

Noise CHOP generates animated channel data

Signals are shaped using:

Math CHOP (scaling / range adjustment)

Filter CHOP (smoothing)

Channels are exported to control parameters such as:

Position

Rotation

Scale

Other operator parameters.
